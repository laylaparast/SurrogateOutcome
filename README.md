`SurrogateOutcome` is an `R` package to estimate the proportion of treatment effect on a censored primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a censored surrogate outcome/event.  

More details on the method are available in Parast, Tian, Cai (2020). Assessing the Value of a Censored Surrogate Outcome. Lifetime Data Analysis, 26(2): 245-265. [doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09473-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10985-019-09473-1). 

The package also implements the optimal transformation approach described in Wang X, Cai T, Tian L, Parast L (2025). Model-free Approach to Evaluate a Censored Intermediate Outcome as a Surrogate for Overall Survival. Statistics in Medicine, 44(20-22): e70268.  [doi:10.1002/sim.70268](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.70268).
