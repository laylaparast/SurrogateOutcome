Description: Provides functions to estimate the proportion of treatment effect on a censored primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a censored surrogate outcome/event. All methods are described in detail in Parast, et al (2020) "Assessing the Value of a Censored Surrogate Outcome" <doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09473-1> and Wang et al (2025) "Model-free Approach to Evaluate a Censored Intermediate Outcome as a Surrogate for Overall Survival" (Under Review) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.14129>.
